\chapter{Introduction}

AudioSciencereview \emph{aka} ASR \footnote{https://www.audiosciencereview.com} is a website created by A. Majidimehr.
His aim is to provide objective data for audio equipements.

This booklet provides an introduction and a set of measurements for speakers measured on ASR.
The introduction explains first why it is important to have measurements and then how to interpret them.
You should be able to decide by yourself how good a loudspeaker is for your use case and if the price
seems adapted.

\section{Why it is important?}

Audio world is plaggued with subjective reviews. They do not help you to make a decision. What ones like is
not necesary what you like. This reviews usually gets more dithyrambic with the price of the speaker and
get you confused.

Science has been studing speakers for a long time and there is a vast amount of scientific research available.
If you only want to read one book on this topic, we advise you to read \cite{Toole2013}. It proves over and over
that you should trust science over subjective reviews, which is what you usually do when you go to a medical
doctor or when you get your car checked. We do not discuss form factor, style or design: they are important criteria
but they are subjective by nature.

In a nutshell, a few graphs characterize pretty well a speaker. You get unbiased informations and then it is
easy to compare between speakers. Some vendors do provides this informations in manuals but very few do. Why?
Possibly because there is very little correlation between price and quality.

\section{What are the most important parameters for a speaker?}

Pragmatically, price, size and look\&feel usually come first and depend on usage. Another question is
active or passive? Active means amplifier and dac are built into the speaker (like most bluetooth speakers)
and passive means a box with drivers, you use a separate amplifier and dac, that's the classical case.

After that, for a given price, what are the speakers which are the most likely to have a pleasing sound? For you
but also for most people as we will see.

Here are 3 key parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item A flat frequency response:

  you expect a speaker to reproduce the sound as it has been put on a CD, a vinyl or a streaming service
  without emphasis. Flat means in a anechoic room, this should not be the case in your room where you expect
  a downward curve, the so-called X-curve.
\item Bass extension:

  bass reproduction is important but requires bigger speakers to go low and to have enough volume. Small speakers
  usually need a subwoofer to cover the full spectrum.
\item Constant directivity:

  when you move off axis (you are not exactly in front of a speaker, or right in the middle), you expect the sound
  to vary regulary).
\end{itemize}

This parameters are now standardized. You can get the standard document for free \cite{CEA2034}.

\chapter{Measurements}

\section{How to read this measurements?}
\section{Where do the measurements come from?}
There are 3 sources of data:
\begin{enumerate}
\item AudioScienceReview: Amir use a special measurement machine built by Klipel. This machine can emulate an anechoid room and provides very precise measurements in a normal room. Methodology is backed by \cite{Klippel2016} and multiple comparisons with anechoid rooms.
\item 3D3A a laboratory within Princeton university. They did a directivity analysis of many speakers \cite{Tylka2015} and published multiple related papers \cite{Tylka2015}, \cite{Tylka2014}.
\item Data provided by vendors. They may or not be accurate. Independant measurements by other organisations help to qualify and improve confidence in this measurements.
\end{enumerate}
