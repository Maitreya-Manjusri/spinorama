    "For the bass area, you need to move a lot of air to produce bass at high volume. The speaker needs to be large to produce a lot of bass but even a large speaker cannot produce that much bass. For high frequencies, the tweeter also usually dip a bit at high frequency but this is not always the case.\n",

Electronic music and movies goes easily down to 20hz. You will need a dedicated speaker called a subwoofer to reproduce this low frequence well and at high volume."
